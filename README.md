# Cybersecurity Incident Report

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing a cybersecurity incident that affected a multimedia company's internal network. The incident involved a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted network services for two hours. As a cybersecurity analyst, my task was to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to assess the incident, develop a comprehensive security strategy, and recommend improvements to enhance the company’s network security posture.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a detailed incident report by analyzing a network incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The aim was to demonstrate a proactive approach to security, enhance communication with stakeholders, and improve the organization’s security practices.

### Skills Learned

- Incident Analysis and Reporting
- Strategic Planning in Cybersecurity
- Application of NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Risk Identification and Mitigation
- Communication with Stakeholders

### Tools and Resources Used

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Utilized to guide the analysis and strategy development.
- Incident Report Template: Structured the analysis and recommendations.
- Internal Network Audit Reports: Provided insight into existing vulnerabilities and network configurations.


## Steps

1. Incident Summary: I summarized the security event, its cause, impact, and the response taken.
2. Identify: I identified the attack type and affected systems.
3. Protect: I described the protective measures implemented to mitigate the attack.
4. Detect: I outlined the detection enhancements made to identify similar threats.
5. Respond: I explained the response strategy for managing and analyzing future incidents.
6. Recover: I detailed the recovery steps to restore normal network operations and prevent future issues.
