# Cybersecurity Incident Report

## Project Background

In this project, I addressed a real-world scenario where a multimedia company experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted the internal network for two hours. The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets, which overwhelmed the network and caused a complete shutdown of services.

As part of the incident management team, we quickly responded by blocking the ICMP packets, shutting down non-critical services, and restoring critical ones. An investigation revealed that the attack was possible due to an unconfigured firewall. To prevent future attacks, we implemented a new firewall rule, source IP verification, network monitoring, and an IDS/IPS system.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a detailed incident report by analyzing a network incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The goal was to demonstrate a proactive approach to security, enhance communication with stakeholders, and improve the organizationâ€™s security practices.

### Skills Learned

- Incident Analysis and Reporting
- Strategic Planning in Cybersecurity
- Application of NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Risk Identification and Mitigation
- Communication with Stakeholders

### Tools and Resources Used

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Utilized to guide the analysis and strategy development.
- Incident Report Template: Structured the analysis and recommendations.
- Internal Network Audit Reports: Provided insight into existing vulnerabilities and network configurations.


## Steps

1. Incident Summary: I summarized the security event, its cause, impact, and the response taken.
2. Identify: I identified the attack type and affected systems.
3. Protect: I described the protective measures implemented to mitigate the attack.
4. Detect: I outlined the detection enhancements made to identify similar threats.
5. Respond: I explained the response strategy for managing and analyzing future incidents.
6. Recover: I detailed the recovery steps to restore normal network operations and prevent future issues.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of a structured approach to incident analysis and response using the NIST CSF. By following this framework, organizations can better protect their assets, detect potential threats, respond effectively to incidents, and recover quickly from disruptions.
