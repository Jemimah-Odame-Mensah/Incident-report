# Cybersecurity Incident Report

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing a cybersecurity incident that affected a multimedia company's internal network. The incident involved a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted network services for two hours. As a cybersecurity analyst, my task was to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to assess the incident, develop a comprehensive security strategy, and recommend improvements to enhance the company’s network security posture.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a detailed incident report by analyzing a network incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The aim was to demonstrate a proactive approach to security, enhance communication with stakeholders, and improve the organization’s security practices.
